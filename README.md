# Physics Senior Project

For my final project in Physics HL, I decided to simulate how a gas would operate in 2 spatial dimensions, and if the laws we've applied to 3-Dimensional gases would remain unchanged.

I simulated the temprature, pressure, and volume of the gas using small circles and simulated their collisions with eachother and the boundries of the box using newtonian physics. 

I stored the data of each particle and average values of them all after the simulations. I got an A+ for this project and was very happy to work on it :]
